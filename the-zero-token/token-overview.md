# Token Overview

**$ZERO** is the governance and utility token that secures the entire protocol.

The ZeroLend Protocol strives to create open and accessible money markets for tokenized assets on a global scale. This objective was set in motion with the protocol's initial release and further advanced through the recent introduction of alternative markets.&#x20;

**$ZERO** token holders face the potential risks associated with the protocol. Stakeholders contribute in practical ways to the protocol, such as integrating it into decentralized finance platforms or providing liquidity. Both groups have certain expectations regarding the protocol's behavior, safety, and functionality.

## Utilities of $ZERO

1. **Governance:** ZERO holders can participate in the governance of the protocol by voting on proposals, changes, and upgrades to the platform. Their voting power is typically proportional to the number of tokens they hold, allowing them to have a say in the decision-making process.
2. **Staking:** ZERO holders will have the option to stake their tokens in the protocol. By doing so, they contribute to the security and stability of the platform and may be rewarded with additional tokens as an incentive for their participation.
3. **Fee Discounts:** Holding the token might provide users with discounted fees or reduced transaction costs when borrowing, lending, or performing other financial activities within the ecosystem.
4. **Fees & Validator Rewards:** The ZERO token can be used to accumulate transaction fees and earn fees from validators securing the ZeroLend [Hyperchain](../features/hyperchains/).
5. **Protocol Access:** Owning the token grants users the ability to interact with and benefit from the protocol's functionalities.
6. **Incentive Programs:** The protocol will conduct various incentive programs to encourage users to engage with the platform actively. These programs can offer token rewards or other benefits to participants who perform certain actions, such as providing liquidity, referring new users, or completing specific tasks within the ecosystem.
7. **Integration with DeFi Ecosystem:** The token could be integrated with other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to use it as collateral, participate in yield farming, or leverage its utility within a broader range of applications and services.
