# Secure-enclave and social logins

## Social Logins

Social logins provide a user-friendly and self-custodial authentication mechanism on ZeroLend. By enabling users to link their Web2 identity with their on-chain account, we aim to lower the entry barriers for beginners. This process eliminates the need for users to interact directly with private keys, offering a seamless onboarding experience.

With social logins, end-users can effortlessly authenticate through their preferred accounts, such as email, phone number, or social media accounts. Users can easily create a smart contract wallet on ZeroLend. You no longer need to download specific wallet applications or manage seed phrases with smart contract wallets.

> We are working with Particle Network to integrate the Social Login feature into our protocol. You can read more about Authentication Infra in the [Particle Network docs](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service).

## Biometrics

ZeroLend supports biometric authentication by incorporating fingerprint recognition and other authentication methods. Biometric authentication provides a secure and user-friendly means of verifying users' identities compared to traditional passwords and private keys. Users can easily authenticate transactions within the ZeroLend ecosystem using their biometric data.

> Anytime you need to sign a transaction, youâ€™ll just have to enter your biometrics to complete the transaction.
