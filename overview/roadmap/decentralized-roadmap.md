# Decentralized Roadmap

ZeroLend started as a centralized protocol to fastrack development decisions. Once our protocol is in its final stages of development, we will start decentralizing ZeroLend to open-source our protocol completely.&#x20;

We will decentralize the following aspects of our protocol:&#x20;

* Incentives & Emissions
* Revenue
* Governance & Protocol Ownership
* Development

### Incentives & Emissions

ZeroLend will use the veToken model to decentralize incentives and emissions immediately after our $ZERO token launch. Read veTokenomics to learn more.&#x20;

Democratizing emissions adds utility to $ZERO tokens. Once veTokenomics is implemented, $ZERO holders can vote and create proposals (initiate changes regarding feature updates to the protocol, minting, burning, etc.).&#x20;

### Revenue

The protocol's revenue will be deposited in the core team's treasury for 12 months after the token launch. This step will ensure we have enough reserves to fund the remaining development phases of the ZeroLend protocol. These funds will also help us provide active leadership to the community.&#x20;

After the first 12 months of the $ZERO token launch, the protocol revenue will be redirected to the insurance fund, community treasury, and for adding $ZERO liquidity.&#x20;

### Governance & Protocol Ownership

The best governance model is the one that requires the least involvement from the team.&#x20;

The core builders of ZeroLend believe that centralized leadership is required to build the project's initial foundation in the protocol's early days. However, centralized leadership should no longer be required as the protocol scales.

Our long-term objective is to minimize governance proposals and remove centralized dependencies. Governance proposals should only be kept for allocations to the community treasury.

### Development

The final phase of decentralization is our protocol's development roadmap. This includes the front-end source code, ownership of ZeroLend's GitHub codebase, and the management of the various repositories.

By the end of our governance roadmap, the core team will open-source all repositories and move all configs into smart contracts.

Multiple third parties would host the front-end codebase. Anyone (with enough $ZERO staked) can change the protocol's codebase.
