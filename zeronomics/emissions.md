# Emissions

The initial supply of $ZERO tokens is set at 500 million. Of this, 450 million will be vote-locked.&#x20;

The initial supply will be distributed every week with a weekly emission of 2% or 10 million $ZERO tokens.&#x20;

The initial supply of $ZERO is around 500 million, out of which 450 million tokens are vote-escrowed.&#x20;

$ZERO follows an exponential decay emissions model, wherein emissions are reduced yearly until they stop. The first six months of $ZERO emissions are inflationary. After six months of TGE, the emissions have become deflationary.
