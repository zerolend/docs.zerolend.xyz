* [Farm the ZeroLend Airdrop](engagement-for-potential-incentives.md)
* Farm the Pyth Airdrop&#x20;

## **Airdrop Distribution Plan**

Should ZeroLend receive governance tokens designated from any of the respective airdrops, we have designed a distribution plan designed to benefit our loyal community members and support the ongoing development of our ecosystem:

1. **40% to ZERO Stakers**: A substantial 40% of any governance token airdrop will be allocated to ZERO stakers. These individuals have played a pivotal role in the growth and success of ZeroLend. This includes **earlyZERO** holders as well.
2. **40% Reserved for Future Incentives and Initiatives**: We believe in continuously incentivizing and driving the growth of our ecosystem. As such, 40% of the airdrop will be reserved for future incentives and initiatives, ensuring that our community members continue to be rewarded for their active participation.
3. **20% for the Development Fund**: Innovation and sustainability are at the core of ZeroLend. To support ongoing development efforts, 20% of the governance token airdrop will be allocated to our development fund. This ensures that we have the necessary resources to maintain and enhance our platform.
