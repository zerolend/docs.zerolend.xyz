## Token Generation Event (est Q1 2024)

During the TGE, a certain portion of the $ZERO supply will be released into the market and will be tradable. This supply is called the circulating supply of the token.

On launch it is estimated that roughly 18.8% of the supply will be circulating. \
\
The table below showcases how much of the supply will released at the TGE.

| Category                                   | % Amount                                  | % Released at TGE (Upfront %) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Private Sale                               | 35%                                       | 25%                           |
| Liquidity                                  | 10%                                       | 60%                           |
| Team                                       | 5%                                        | 0%                            |
| Treasury                                   | 5%                                        | 0%                            |
| Advisors                                   | 7%                                        | 25%                           |
| Airdrops                                   | 18%                                       | 40%                           |
| Emissions                                  | 20%                                       | 0%                            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Total**</mark> | <mark style="color:blue;">**100%**</mark> | -                             |

Given that the project's initial FDV is set at $25mn FDV and the initial circulating supply at TGE is 18.8%, the initial circulating market cap is **roughly $4.7mn.**

## Distribution over time

To ensure that the ZERO token's tokenomics can sustain long-term, most of its inflation (from liquidity, treasury, private sale, etc.) will end within the first year.&#x20;

After the one-year period, tokenomics is designed to behave scarcely with inflation, with emissions cut down by half every 12 months.

By the end of the first year, roughly 78% of the token supply will be circulating. After that, the remaining 22% will be released over an exponential decay of time.

## Detailed month-by-month distribution

For those who'd like to examine precise numbers on how much ZERO will be added to circulation month by month, an Excel sheet (linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-f0nKKN1\_BwnSpnFm9FJ4XnscF9t968q8qwoRTUT6E/edit#gid=736372284)) has been created, which digs deeper into how many new tokens are added.
