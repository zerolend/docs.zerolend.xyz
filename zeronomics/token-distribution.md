# Token Distribution

The $ZERO token will be launched in April 2024. The total supply of $ZERO is capped at 100 billion. $ZERO tokens will follow a linear vesting with a lock-up period of up to 4 years.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of $ZERO token distribution:&#x20;

## Token Generation Event (est Q1 2024)

During our token generation event (TGE) in April 2024, we will release nearly 30% of our total token supply into circulation.

The initial Fully Diluted Valuation or FDV is set at {add number}, and the initial circulating supply at TGE is set at {add percentage}. This brings the initial circulating market cap of $ZERO tokens to be roughly {ad number}.

Given that the project's initial FDV is set at $25mn FDV and the initial circulating supply at TGE is 18.8%, the initial circulating market cap is roughly $4.7mn.

### Token Distribution

To ensure that $ZERO tokenomics is sustainable in the long term, most of the $ZERO token inflation (from liquidity, treasury, private sale, etc.) will end within 1 year from the token launch.&#x20;

The $ZERO emissions will be reduced by half every 12 months post 1 year of launch.&#x20;

After 12 months from TGE, roughly 78% of the token supply will be in circulation. The remaining 22% of the supply will be released using exponential decay.&#x20;

On launch it is estimated that roughly 18.8% of the supply will be circulating on launch. \

The table below showcases how much of the supply will released at the TGE.
