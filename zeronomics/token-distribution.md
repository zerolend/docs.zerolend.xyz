# Token Distribution

The $ZERO token will be launched in April 2024. The total supply of $ZERO is capped at 100 billion. $ZERO tokens will follow a linear vesting with a lock-up period of up to 4 years.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of $ZERO token distribution:&#x20;

## Token Generation Event (est Q1 2024)

During our token generation event (TGE) in April 2024, we will release nearly 30% of our total token supply into circulation.

With a circulating supply of approximately 25% at the time of the Token Generation Event (TGE) and a Fixed Dollar Value (FDV) of $25 million, the initial circulating market capitalization is estimated to be around **$5.25 million**

### Token Distribution

To ensure that $ZERO tokenomics is sustainable in the long term, most of the $ZERO token inflation (from liquidity, treasury, private sale, etc.) will end within 1 year from the token launch.&#x20;

The $ZERO emissions will be reduced by half every 12 months post 1 year of launch.&#x20;

After 12 months from TGE, roughly 78% of the token supply will be in circulation. The remaining 22% will be released using exponential decay.&#x20;

## Detailed month-by-month distribution

For those who'd like to examine precise numbers on how much ZERO will be added to circulation month by month, an Excel sheet (linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-f0nKKN1\_BwnSpnFm9FJ4XnscF9t968q8qwoRTUT6E/edit#gid=736372284)) has been created, which digs deeper into the number of new tokens added.
