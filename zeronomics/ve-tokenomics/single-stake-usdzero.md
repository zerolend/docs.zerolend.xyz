# Single Stake $ZERO

Single-Stake $ZERO works similar to the traditional principles of ve-token models. Participants stake $ZERO tokens to acquire $veZERO, with the amount received directly correlating to the duration of the tokens locked.

### **Locking Rates and Calculation Method**

| Time Lock | L\_ZERO - Value |
| --------- | --------------- |
| 1-Months  | 0.0208          |
| 3-Months  | 0.0625          |
| 6-Months  | 0.125           |
| 12-Months | 0.25            |
| 24-months | 0.5             |
| 48-months | 1.0             |

#### Equation for $veZERO Allocation:&#x20;

$$
\$\textrm{veZERO} = \$\textrm{ZERO}_1 \times L_{ZERO}
$$

**Practical Example:**

* **Scenario**: A user decides to stake 10,000 $ZERO tokens for a period of 6 months.
* **Outcome**: Based on the locking rates, this action results in the user receiving 1,250 $veZERO.
