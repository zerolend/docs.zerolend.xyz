# Chapter 2: LiftOff ðŸš€

**Duration:** The specific start and end dates for the LiftOff chapter are yet to be announced.

**Objective:** The goal of LiftOff will be declared in conjunction with its launch, focusing on advancing ZeroLendâ€™s competitiveness among the top lending markets.

### **Token Distribution**

* **Airdrop Allocation:** 3% of the total $ZERO supply, totaling 3 billion tokens, is set aside for this chapter.
* **Participant Eligibility:** All users who engage with ZeroLend during the LiftOff chapter are eligible to receive $ZERO tokens from the designated pool.

### **Strategic Importance of LiftOff**

The LiftOff chapter is aptly named to signify the progression of ZeroLendâ€™s journey post-Token Generation Event (TGE), aiming to escalate its market position and operational influence. This phase is crucial as it symbolizes the transition from the foundational establishment to aggressive market penetration and growth.

### **Incentive for Continued Participation**

* **Boost for Returning Users:** Individuals who participated in the initial Ignition chapter will benefit from a 1.5x multiplier on the points they earn in LiftOff. This incentive is designed to maintain user engagement and investment in the protocol, fostering a loyal user base that supports sustained growth.
* **Encouraging Loyalty:** By rewarding previous participants with enhanced multipliers, ZeroLend acknowledges their early support and encourages continued participation, which is vital for the protocolâ€™s long-term success.
