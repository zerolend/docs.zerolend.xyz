# Chapter 1: Ignition ðŸ”¥

#### **Duration:** Is now live - 6th May

#### **Objective:** The primary goal for this chapter is to reach a TVL (Total Value Locked) of 1 billion USD, establishing a strong liquidity foundation for ZeroLend.

### **Token Distribution**

* **Airdrop Allocation:** 5% of the total $ZERO supply, equivalent to 5 billion tokens, is earmarked for distribution during this chapter.
* **Distribution Platform:** Participants can access and engage with the airdrop via [airdrop.zerolend.xyz](http://airdrop.zerolend.xyz/).

**Strategic Importance of Ignition:** Ignition is designed to "fuel" the growth trajectory of ZeroLend. This initial phase of the voyage has the highest reward pool, specifically targeting early adopters. The aim is to incentivize these participants to contribute significantly to bootstrapping the protocolâ€™s liquidity, vital for its scalability and success.

### **Reward Dynamics**

* **Early Participation:** Users who were part of Zero Gravity before April 10th are eligible for participation in Ignition and will receive the highest rewards. This encourages and benefits the earliest supporters of the protocol.
* **Decreasing Multipliers:** To further encourage early engagement, Ignition implements a system where the multipliers awarded to points decrease with each passing week. This means that participants benefit more significantly from engaging sooner rather than later.

Through these mechanisms, Ignition seeks to rapidly expand ZeroLendâ€™s operational scale and market presence, setting a robust stage for the subsequent chapters of the voyage. The chapterâ€™s structure is meticulously crafted to attract substantial liquidity early on, critical for maintaining momentum in ZeroLend's expansive growth plans.
