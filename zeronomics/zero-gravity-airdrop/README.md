# Zero Gravity Airdrop

## Structuring the Zero Gravity Drop <a href="#heading-structuring-the-zero-gravity-drop" id="heading-structuring-the-zero-gravity-drop"></a>

Zero Gravity will be phased out in Voyages and Chapters. Each Voyage will have 3 Chapters.

Here’s a basic structure:

* Voyage 1
  * Chapter 1
  * Chapter 2
  * Chapter 3
* Voyage 2
* Voyage 3

**With each passing Voyage and Chapter, the supply % decreases to reward the early adopters of the protocol.**

The earliest adopters are users who used Zero Gravity since its [soft launch](https://twitter.com/zerolendxyz/status/1748367922475745556) on Jan 19, 2024. They are eligible for the highest drop.

### Maximizing the Drop

Users can maximize their benefits from the $ZERO drop by engaging in various activities within the ZeroLend ecosystem:

1. **Supplying and Borrowing**: Primary rewards will be allocated to users who supply liquidity or borrow from any of ZeroLend’s markets. Detailed guides are available to assist users in these processes:
   * [How to Supply on ZeroLend?](https://docs.zerolend.xyz/tutorials/how-to-supply-on-zerolend)
   * [How to Borrow on ZeroLend?](https://docs.zerolend.xyz/tutorials/how-to-borrow-on-zerolend)
2. **Supplying $ETH**: Given the high demand for borrowing $ETH, users supplying $ETH will receive enhanced rewards, earning two points per USD per day, as opposed to one point for other assets.
3. **Participating in Ecosystem Partner Projects**: Users can earn additional points by engaging with partner projects listed on the Zero Gravity platform, which is regularly updated to include new partners.
4. **Referrals**: Referring new users to ZeroLend results in a 20% bonus in points for both the referrer and the referred, enhancing the benefits for active community members.
