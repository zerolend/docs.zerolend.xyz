# Oracles

In decentralized lending protocols like ZeroLend, an oracle is essential for fetching accurate and reliable price data of digital assets and other financial instruments.&#x20;

By providing this external information to the blockchain, oracles enable smart contracts to make informed decisions based on real-time market conditions. Oracles help determine collateral values, interest rates, and liquidation events.&#x20;

ZeroLend uses three Oracle providers to determine price feeds for various assets:

* Chainlink
* Pyth Network
* Redstone
