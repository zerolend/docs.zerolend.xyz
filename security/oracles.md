# Oracles

In decentralized lending protocols like ZeroLend, an oracle is essential for fetching accurate and reliable price data of digital assets and other financial instruments.&#x20;

By providing this external information to the blockchain, oracles enable smart contracts to make informed decisions based on real-time market conditions. Oracles help determine collateral values, interest rates, and liquidation events.&#x20;

ZeroLend uses four Oracle providers to determine price feeds for various assets:

* [Pyth Network](oracles/pyth-oracles.md)
* [Redstone](oracles/redstone.md)
* [Chainlink](oracles/chainlink.md)
* [API3](oracles/api3-oracles.md)
