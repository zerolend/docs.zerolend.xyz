# Emission Strategy

## About Emissions

The supply of $ZERO tokens set out for emissions is kept at 20 billion tokens (20% of the supply)

The first six months of $ZERO emissions are inflationary. After six months of TGE, the emissions have become deflationary.



**ZeroLend plans implement a hardcoded 4:1 emissions ratio for borrowing and lending, respectively.** This incentive structure is predicated on the principle that borrowing necessitates collateralized lending; thus, by encouraging borrowing, the platform inherently promotes more lending.&#x20;

This strategy is expected to elevate APYs in borrowing and lending pools, augmenting revenue for the company and potentially leading to increased buybacks and emissions.

## Types of Emissions

ZeroLend features two types of emissions as part of its incentive structure:

1. **Primary Emissions**: Rewards specific to assets.
2. **Secondary Emissions**: Rewards distributed in $ZERO tokens.

Our focus here is on **Secondary Emissions** as they are the only emissions affected by $veZERO.&#x20;

## Example of Secondary Emissions Distribution

Let's assume ZeroLend plans to distribute 1 million $ZERO tokens as ecosystem incentives. The allocation of these tokens is determined by the $veZERO delegated to each asset. Here's a simplified breakdown:

| Asset  | $veZERO Delegated | Percentage of Total $veZERO | $ZERO Rewards |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| $USDC  | 30M               | 30%                         | 300K          |
| $ETH   | 20M               | 20%                         | 200K          |
| $MANTA | 50M               | 50%                         | 500K          |

In this scenario:

* **$USDC** receives 300,000 $ZERO, as it holds 30% of the total $veZERO delegated.
* **$ETH** is allocated 200,000 $ZERO, corresponding to its 20% share.
* **$MANTA** gets 500,000 $ZERO, being the largest beneficiary with 50% of $veZERO delegation.

This allocation demonstrates how the delegation of $veZERO directly impacts the distribution of secondary emissions, encouraging stakeholders to strategically delegate their tokens to enhance specific assets within the ZeroLend ecosystem
