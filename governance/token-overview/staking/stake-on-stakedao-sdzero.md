# Stake on StakeDAO (sdZERO)

StakeDAO integrated the ZERO token to launch a Liquid Locker for the $ZERO token on Linea.&#x20;

This is an important step forward in how users interact with veZERO, which is that staking no longer has to mean sacrificing liquidity.

The Liquid Locker allows users to mint sdZERO, a liquid wrapper around veZERO that keeps all the essential benefits: governance rights, protocol rewards, and fee sharing. But unlike veZERO, sdZERO can be moved and traded.&#x20;

This is a significant unlock whether you’re a long-term staker, or a veZERO holder.&#x20;

## How it works

To get started, head to [StakeDAO’s ZERO Locker](https://www.stakedao.org/lockers/zero). You’ll be able to mint sdZERO by either ZERO tokens or veZERO NFTs.

You'll have to approve and mint to get sdZERO.&#x20;

Once minted, sdZERO can be staked again in the gauge to unlock more benefits exclusively available only to sdZERO stakers (this part is optional)

Liquidity for sdZERO will be enabled via secondary markets on Nile _**`(Link here once live)`**_

If you’re already holding veZERO (through vesting), you’re not excluded. You can migrate your veNFT into StakeDAO’s locker and mint sdZERO directly—no need to wait for your lock to expire.

This integration brings the utility of liquid lockers to ZeroLend while placing ZERO in front of a new and active audience of governance-aligned users across the StakeDAO and Linea ecosystems.
