# Token Distribution

Here’s a detailed breakdown of $ZERO token distribution:&#x20;

## &#x20;Token Distribution&#x20;

To ensure that $ZERO tokenomics is sustainable long-term, most of the $ZERO token inflation (from liquidity, treasury, private sale, etc.) will end within 1 year from the token launch.&#x20;

The $ZERO emissions will be reduced by half every 12 months post 1 year of launch.&#x20;

After 12 months from TGE, roughly 78% of the token supply will be in circulation. The remaining 22% will be released using exponential decay.&#x20;

## Detailed month-by-month distribution

For those who would like to examine precise numbers on how much ZERO will be added to circulation month by month, an Excel sheet (linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-f0nKKN1\_BwnSpnFm9FJ4XnscF9t968q8qwoRTUT6E/edit#gid=736372284)) has been created, which digs deeper into the number of new tokens added.
