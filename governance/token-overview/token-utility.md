# Token Utility

The ZeroLend ecosystem is designed to create value for token holders and stakers. Here are some of the utilities of the ZERO token. \


1. **Staking:** Ve-tokenomics is a pivotal component of ZeroLend's economic structure. Staking $ZERO tokens for a predetermined duration and receiving vote-escrowed (ve) tokens. Zerolend introduces a unique ve-model that incorporates both single token staking and dLP staking.&#x20;
2. **Protocol Fees:** $ZERO tokens can be used to pay fees on ZeroLend.
3. **Incentives:** Users who add liquidity on ZeroLend, refer users to ZeroLend, or complete other tasks to grow the protocol will be rewarded using $ZERO tokens. All future potential airdrops the protocol receives will also be distributed back amongst token stakers.&#x20;
4. **Integration with DeFi Ecosystem:** $ZERO will be integrated with other DeFi platforms. This cross-platform integration enables users to use $ZERO as collateral for DeFi loans, yield farming, or leverage its utility across other DeFi use cases.
