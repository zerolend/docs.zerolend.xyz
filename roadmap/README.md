# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this roadmap is a general outline and is subject to adjustments based on market conditions, regulatory considerations, and community feedback.
{% endhint %}

### Milestone 0: Pre-mine of ZERO

This is the first phase of our roadmap. It will be used to bootstrap liquidity for the protocol.

### Milestone 1: Launch of veTokenomics

Once the $ZERO token is live, we will introduce veTokenomics and decentralize its incentive mechanism across supported chains. With veTokenomics, $ZERO holders will lock their $ZERO tokens for a set period and receive non-transferable veTokens.

Although users cannot sell veTokens, they can use them to participate in protocol governance. This step will help us achieve minimal governance and decentralize the token utility at scale.

Adopting veTokenomics will help us reduce the token supply while encouraging holders for long-term participation in the ZeroLend ecosystem.

### Milestone 2: Introduction of Isolated Immutable Markets

ZeroLend will introduce isolated, immutable markets to scale our protocol across multiple markets. Isolated immutable markets work similarly to Morpho Blue. Unlike other markets, these markets do not impact the lending pools when operating at scale.&#x20;

### Milestone 3: Vaults &#x20;

Once our isolated markets are live, we will launch vaults. These vaults will enable users to access more yields and strategies through simple one-click vaults.&#x20;

Vaults can further be curated with risk managers to ensure risk parameters are continuously updated individually. In the future, sub-DAOs could actively manage risks and create their managed vaults.&#x20;

### Milestone 4: Scaling markets across EVM-based chains&#x20;

In Phase 4, we will provide guidelines and open up the markets to allow users to scale up markets on ZeroLend rapidly.

We will enable anyone to create a deployment on any chain or list assets on the ZeroLend UI using a whitelisted factory contract.&#x20;

### Milestone 5: Work on UI redesign

Once the ZeroLend protocol is live, we will rebuild the user interface to improve user experience across all ZeroLend services. This UI revamp involves integrating points within the user interface, enabling multiple chains to be integrated on ZeroLend, etc.&#x20;

This is not an isolated phase in our roadmap. We will work on ZeroLend’s user interface in sync with other protocol development phases.&#x20;

### Final Milestone: Open-source ZeroLend Protocol&#x20;

The final phase of our roadmap is to open-source our protocol and decentralize its governance.
