## Phase 1: Launch and Pre-mining

Once the development and testing phase is complete, ZeroLend launches the lending protocol on zkSync and starts the pre-mine phase of the token. Users can provide liquidity and farm $ZERO pre-launch.

Users can also participate within the community to earn points which makes them eligible for the $ZERO airdrop

#### Key Milestones:

1. Smart contract deployment on the mainnet.
2. Launch of the ZeroLend platform to the public.
3. Launch of the ZeroLend stablecoin ([ONEZ](../onez.md)).
4. Airdrop campaigns and co-marketing with projects
5. Marketing and user acquisition efforts.

## **Phase 2: Incentives & Official Protocol launch**

ZeroLend embarks on a vital phase with the initiation of public and private sales, leading up to the Token Generation Event (TGE). The $ZERO token makes its debut and becomes tradable across various markets (DEXes and CEXes).

At this stage, the various incentive mechanisms start to go live. This includes staking, liquidity mining, etc.., to further grow the protocol.

**Key Milestones:**

1. Conducting Private and Public Sales of $ZERO.
2. Launching $ZERO on multiple exchanges post-TGE.
3. Launch of protocol incentives (Staking, Emissions, etc..)

## **Phase 3: RWA Lending**

In this stage, ZeroLend focuses on integrating Real World Assets (RWAs) like Treasury Bills, Bonds, and Real Estate, thus merging traditional financial assets with the efficiency and accessibility of DeFi lending.

**Key Milestones:**

1. Onboarding a variety of RWAs onto the lending platform.
2. Creating new opportunities for asset-backed lending and borrowing.
3. Facilitating a seamless market for both digital and traditional investors.

## **Phase 4: Account Abstraction & Hyperchains**

Building upon Account Abstraction and zk hyperchains, this phase is dedicated to achieving low gas fees and enhanced user privacy, aligning with our vision of providing a cost-efficient and secure DeFi environment.

**Key Milestones:**

1. Integrating Account Abstraction for Simplified User Transactions.
2. Leveraging zkSync's hyperchains to ensure low-cost operations and privacy.
3. Enhancing the overall protocol infrastructure for better performance.
