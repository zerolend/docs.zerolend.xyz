# Phase 1 Launch

During the launch phase, ZeroLend actively seeks out strategic partnerships within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The team engages with prominent DeFi projects, blockchain platforms, and liquidity providers to establish mutually beneficial collaborations. These partnerships can range from technical integrations to marketing initiatives aimed at increasing liquidity, expanding the range of supported assets, and enhancing the overall user experience within the lending protocol.

## $ZERO Airdrop for Users&#x20;

As part of the launch phase, ZeroLend introduces an opportunity for users to receive a $**ZERO** token airdrop. Any user interacting with the lending protocol during this phase, either by borrowing or lending, will be eligible to receive a predetermined amount of $**ZERO** tokens as a reward.

To be eligible for the airdrop, you need to provide liquidity to the protocol and start farming $**earlyZERO**.

You can become eligible for the ZERO airdrop by either having a history with interacting with other protocols or by interacting our social. To learn more about eligibility criterias read ["ZeroLend Airdrop"](../zeronomics/airdrop-incentives/engagement-for-potential-incentives.md).

Please feel free to visit [http://app.zerolend.xyz/](http://app.zerolend.xyz/) and start interacting with the application.

## About $earlyZERO Rewards <a href="#ad5f" id="ad5f"></a>

To allow farming before the TGE, users who provide liquidity can claim **$earlyZERO**, a non-transferrable ERC20 token that can be claimed by users from the farming portal before the TGE.

Users can convert the earned **$earlyZERO to $ZERO** after **$ZERO** TGE. Received **$ZERO** may have a vesting period.

* **Exchange Rate**: 1 $earlyZERO = 1 $ZERO (1:1)
* **Total $ZERO supply**: 100,000,000,000 $ZERO
