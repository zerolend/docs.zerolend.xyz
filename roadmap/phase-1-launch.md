# Phase 1 Launch

We are excited to share the launch of ZeroLend's Phase 1, where we plan to launch the $ZERO token on zkSync.

ZeroLend will seek strategic partnerships within the DeFi ecosystem during the launch phase. We will engage with prominent DeFi projects, blockchain platforms, and liquidity providers to establish mutually beneficial collaborations.&#x20;

These partnerships can range from technical integrations to marketing initiatives to increase liquidity, expand the range of supported assets, and enhance the overall user experience on ZeroLend.&#x20;

### $ZERO Airdrop for Users

Users can earn $ZERO tokens during the launch phase by participating in $ZERO Gravity and other $ZERO airdrop campaigns. Any user interacting with ZeroLend during this phase, either by borrowing or lending, will be eligible to receive a predetermined amount of $ZERO tokens as a reward.

To learn more about $ZERO airdrop eligibility, read [ZeroLend Airdrop](https://docs.zerolend.xyz/zeronomics/airdrop-incentives/engagement-for-potential-incentives).

Visit[ http://app.zerolend.xyz/](http://app.zerolend.xyz/) and start using ZeroLend to farm $ZERO.&#x20;

### About $earlyZERO Rewards

Liquidity providers on ZeroLend will receive $earlyZERO, a non-transferrable ERC-20 token that can be redeemed for $ZERO after TGE.&#x20;

Please note that $ZERO redeemed using $earlyZERO may have a vesting period.

* Exchange Rate: 1 $earlyZERO = 1 $ZERO (1:1)
* Total $ZERO supply: 100,000,000,000 &#x20;
