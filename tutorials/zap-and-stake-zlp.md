# Zap & Stake zLP

The zLP (ZeroLend Liquidity Provider) functionality allows users to stake their assets into ZeroLendâ€™s liquidity pools easily and efficiently. With the **Zap and Stake functionality**, you can convert ETH into LP tokens and stake them in a single click.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of staking via Zap and provide information on staking your LP tokens directly.

## **Zap Functionality**

The Zap functionality is designed to simplify the staking process by allowing users to stake their ETH directly into ZeroLend LP with just one click.

## **Steps to Stake via Zap**

1. **Go to the Staking Page:**
   * Visit [ZeroLend Staking](https://app.zerolend.xyz/stake/?marketName=proto\_linea\_v3).
   * Click on the "Zap and Stake" button.
2. **Input the Amount:**
   * Enter the amount of ETH you wish to stake.
   * The system will prompt a transaction for you to sign and confirm.
3. **One-Click Conversion:**
   * In one click, your ETH will be converted into LP tokens and staked for the duration you choose.
   * For example, if you input 0.1 ETH, it will be converted into LP tokens, which are then staked.

## **Direct Staking**

If you already have LP tokens, you can stake them directly without converting ETH.

1. **Stake LP Tokens:**
   * Go to the [staking page](https://app.zerolend.xyz/stake/?marketName=proto\_linea\_v3).
   * Select the option to stake your existing LP tokens.

## **Details of Staking through Zap**

* **Maximum Duration:** Staking through Zap has a maximum duration of one year.
* **Revenue Distribution:** All revenue from borrowing and lending goes to LP stakers daily.
* **Rewards:** Single token stakers receive ZERO rewards and emissions; however, revenue is distributed to LP stakers.
* **Claiming Rewards:** The Zap stakes for you, but you need to claim the rewards.

#### **Example**

* If you Zap and stake 0.1 ETH (\~$380 USD), it splits into $180 USD of ZERO and $180 of ETH.
* These amounts are added to liquidity, and the locked LP tokens are converted into voting power on the dashboard.

## **How to Stake**

#### **1. Zap and Stake**

* **If you have ETH but no ZERO:**
  * Click on the Zap button.
  * Half of your ETH will be converted to ZERO.
  * The ETH and ZERO are then LPed on the Nile exchange and staked in a single click.

#### **2. Stake ZERO/ETH LP**

* **If you are already an LP on the Nile:**
  * Simply stake your existing ZERO/ETH LP tokens.

## **Benefits of LP Staking**

* **Daily Revenue:** All revenue from borrowing and lending is distributed to LP stakers daily.
* **Voting Power:** Staked LP tokens provide voting power in the ZeroLend ecosystem.
