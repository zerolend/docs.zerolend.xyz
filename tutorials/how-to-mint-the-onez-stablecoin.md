## Step 3: (Optional) Enable E-mode

If you are supplying USDC to the protocol, there is the option to further create more price efficiency by enabling E-mode.

This lets you borrow ONEZ with upto 97% LTV worth of your USDC.

Enable the ONEZ E-mode by visiting the "E-mode button" on the Your borrows section and choose the ONEZ Stablecoin category. You can now borrow upto 97% worth of your USDC ðŸ’ª
