## BTC LRT Market

ZeroLend has expanded to support **Bitcoin** Liquid Restaking Tokens **(BTC LRTs)** on the mainnet, which enables Bitcoin holders to benefit from staking/locking rewards while engaging with DeFi. Some examples include **cbBTC**, **eBTC**, **LBTC**, **MBTC**, **SolvBTC**, and **WBTC**.

#### How to Earn BTC LRT Yields on ZeroLend

1. **Acquire BTC LRT Tokens:** Obtain BTC LRT (e.g., cbBTC, eBTC) from its issuing protocol or a supporting exchange.
2. **Navigate to ZeroLend:** Visit [https://app.zerolend.xyz](https://app.zerolend.xyz) and switch to the **Bitcoin LRTs Market** from the dropdown menu.
3. **Select Your BTC LRT:** From the list of supported assets (e.g., cbBTC, eBTC, LBTC), review the supply APY and any additional rewards.
4. **Supply BTC LRT:**
   * Click “Details” to confirm APY and other terms.
   * Enter the amount of BTC LRT you’d like to deposit and complete the supply transaction.
