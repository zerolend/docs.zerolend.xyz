# Stake ZERO (zLP) Tokens

The zLP (ZeroLend Liquidity Provider) functionality allows users to stake their ZERO/ETH LP.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of staking via Zap and provide information on staking your LP tokens directly.

But before that, let's cover the benefits of zLP staking.

## **Benefits of zLP Staking**

* **LXP-L from Linea:** As $ZERO is a whitelisted asset on Linea Surge, users who supply liquidity or stake it is eligible for LXP-L and, therefore, the Linea airdrop.
* **Daily Revenue:** All revenue from borrowing and lending is distributed to LP stakers daily in $ETH.
* **Voting Power:** Staked LP tokens provide voting power in the ZeroLend ecosystem.

## **Stake via Zap Functionality**

The Zap functionality is designed to simplify the staking process by allowing users to stake their ETH directly into ZeroLend LP with just one click.

You just need ETH with this method.

### **Steps to Stake via Zap**

1.  **Go to the Staking Page:**

    * Visit [ZeroLend Staking](https://app.zerolend.xyz/stake/?marketName=proto\_linea\_v3).
    * Click on the "Zap and Stake" button.

2.  **Input the Amount:**

    * Enter the amount of ETH you wish to stake.
    * The system will prompt a transaction for you to sign and confirm.

3. **One-Click Conversion:**
   * In one click, your ETH will be converted into LP tokens and staked for the duration you choose.
   * For example, if you Zap and stake 0.1 ETH (\~$380 USD), it splits into $180 USD of ZERO and $180 of ETH. These amounts are added to liquidity on the DEX (Nile), and the LP tokens are staked and converted into voting power.

## **Staking after providing liquidity on a DEX**

With this method, you will have to provide liquidity for ZERO / ETH on Nile.

1. Get $ZERO tokens from a DEX like Nile if you don't have them already
2. Provide $ZERO / ETH liquidity on the Nile pool - [https://www.nile.build/manage/v1/0x0040f36784dda0821e74ba67f86e084d70d67a3a](https://www.nile.build/manage/v1/0x0040f36784dda0821e74ba67f86e084d70d67a3a)
