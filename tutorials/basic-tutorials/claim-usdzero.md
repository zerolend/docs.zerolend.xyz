# Claim $ZERO

{% hint style="info" %}
$ZERO allocation for users who redeem their Zero Gravity points or $earlyZERO tokens for $ZERO follows the same vesting schedule:&#x20;

* 40% of the airdrop allocation will be distributed upfront to users.&#x20;
* The remaining 60% will have a 6-month vesting schedule - 3 months cliff and 3-months linear vesting
{% endhint %}

ZeroLend users and investors can claim the upfront $ZERO tokens and stake / vest the remaining tokens.&#x20;

Lets dive into the 2 categories of users and the step-by-step guide for both:&#x20;

* Airdrop users
* Investors&#x20;

***

### Airdrop Users&#x20;

All eligible airdrop users can claim $ZERO against their $earlyZERO tokens and Zero Gravity points.&#x20;

Your $ZERO allocation will depend on the $earlyZERO tokens and Zero Gravity points you have accumulated and will be automatically converted to ZERO on launch and users will only be able to see their final ZERO airdrop.&#x20;

Please note that we have allocated a major portion of the $ZERO airdrop to the liquidity providers on our lending markets.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Tokens earned are vested with 40% unlock, 3 months cliff, followed by 3 months linear vesting.

Users can claim upfront tokens and stake vested tokens without waiting for the vesting period to end, and they will receive staking benefits.
