# Credit Card

The ZeroLend Credit Card allows users to spend their crypto assets in everyday transactions without selling them. Instead of converting holdings into fiat, users can deposit their crypto as collateral on ZeroLend, take out a loan in USDC, and use that USDC to make payments with the card. This provides a seamless way to access liquidity while retaining ownership of crypto assets.

Unlike traditional crypto debit cards that require users to pre-load funds by selling their tokens, the ZeroLend Credit Card functions as a credit line against crypto collateral. It automatically borrows USDC when needed and settles transactions in real time. Whether you are a long-term investor or a meme coin holder, this card makes it possible to use crypto for daily purchases without exiting your positions.

## How the ZeroLend Credit Card Works

The ZeroLend Credit Card operates through a simple and automated process:

**1. Depositing Collateral:** Users deposit their crypto assets (such as FOXY, ETH, or any supported token) into ZeroLend’s platform. These assets remain in their control but are used as collateral to back a borrowing position.

**2. Borrowing USDC:** Once collateral is deposited, the platform automatically issues a loan in USDC. The loan amount is determined based on the collateral’s value and the system’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

**3. Spending USDC via the Card:** The borrowed USDC is immediately available on the ZeroLend Credit Card, which can be used at any merchant that accepts Visa or Mastercard. This means users can pay for groceries, coffee, online purchases, and more using their crypto-backed credit.

**4. Repaying the Loan:** Users can repay the borrowed USDC at any time. If they choose not to, their collateral remains staked, and depending on the asset, it may generate yield that can help offset interest or loan repayments. If the value of the collateral increases, borrowing power grows, giving users access to more liquidity without additional deposits.&#x20;

## Key Benefits of the ZeroLend Credit Card

The ZeroLend Credit Card provides a way to access spending power without selling crypto holdings. Users benefit from the flexibility of spending their assets without worrying about market timing or capital gains taxes that might apply when selling crypto for fiat.

One of the primary advantages of this system is that it works globally. Since the card is backed by major payment networks like Visa or Mastercard, it is accepted almost anywhere that traditional credit and debit cards are used. There is no need for merchants to support crypto payments directly—ZeroLend handles the conversion behind the scenes.

Another advantage is flexible repayment. Unlike a traditional credit card with fixed due dates and interest charges, the ZeroLend Credit Card allows users to repay on their own schedule. Borrowed USDC can be repaid anytime, and there are no penalties for early repayment. As long as sufficient collateral remains in the system, users can continue spending without worrying about immediate repayment obligations.

## Who Can Benefit from the ZeroLend Credit Card?

This card is designed for a wide range of crypto users. Long-term investors who want to preserve their holdings while gaining access to liquidity will find it useful for covering daily expenses. Memecoin holders who experience price volatility can leverage their holdings for real-world spending without cashing out during market dips. DeFi users who frequently borrow and lend assets will appreciate the added convenience of a credit line directly linked to their holdings.

By offering an alternative to selling, the ZeroLend Credit Card provides an efficient way to maintain exposure to crypto assets while gaining practical spending power. It integrates the best of decentralized finance with real-world usability, making it a valuable tool for those who believe in the long-term potential of their crypto investments.&#x20;
