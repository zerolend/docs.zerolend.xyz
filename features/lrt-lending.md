# LRT Lending

Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) are tokenized derivatives representing staked assets. LRTs enable you to unlock the liquidity of your staked asset while also earning staking rewards.&#x20;

When you stake $ETH to validate transactions on Ethereum and secure the network, your deposited $ETH is locked for a certain period. LRTs help you tokenize the staked $ETH into a derivative asset. The derivative token can be freely used across supported DeFi applications.

Here’s how LRTs work behind the scenes: &#x20;

1. Users deposit and stake their assets (e.g., ETH) with a liquid staking protocol.
2. The protocol issues LRT tokens (e.g., $ezETH) in a 1:1 ratio, representing the staked $ETH.
3. Users can trade, lend, or use these LRT tokens across their preferred DeFi applications while earning staking rewards.

In addition to staking rewards, users earn points from the respective liquid staking protocol and the partner protocols (if any).&#x20;

For example, if you restake $ETH on Renzo Protocol, you get $ezETH and EigenLayer points.&#x20;
