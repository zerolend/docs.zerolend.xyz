# LRT Lending

Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) are tokenized derivatives representing staked assets. LRTs enable you to unlock the liquidity of your staked asset while also earning staking rewards.&#x20;

When you stake $ETH to validate transactions on Ethereum and secure the network, your deposited $ETH is locked for a certain period. LRTs help you tokenize the staked $ETH into a derivative asset. The derivative token can be freely used across supported DeFi applications.

Here’s how LRTs work behind the scenes: &#x20;

1. Users deposit and stake their assets (e.g., ETH) with a liquid staking protocol.
2. The protocol issues LRT tokens (e.g., $ezETH) in a 1:1 ratio, representing the staked $ETH.
3. Users can trade, lend, or use these LRT tokens across their preferred DeFi applications while earning staking rewards.

In addition to staking rewards, users earn points from the respective liquid staking protocol and the partner protocols (if any).&#x20;

For example, if you restake $ETH on Renzo Protocol, you get $ezETH and EigenLayer points.&#x20;

### Benefits

* Earn staking rewards while using LRTs as collateral
* Earn additional points from liquid staking protocols
* Access liquidity without unstaking
* Dedicated LRT markets with boosted rewards

### ETH LRTs on ZeroLend  <a href="#lrtsonzerolend" id="lrtsonzerolend"></a>

ZeroLend features a dedicated ETH LRTs Market to help users leverage the emerging LRT trend and earn boosted rewards.



Here’s a list of ETH LRT assets listed on ZeroLend:&#x20;

| LRT Project  | Native LRT Asset  | Supported ZeroLend Market  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Renzo        | $ezETH            | Ethereum, Linea, Blast     |
| Ether.fi     | $weETH            | Ethereum                   |
| Kelp DAO     | $rsETH            | Ethereum                   |
| Puffer       | $pufETH           | Ethereum                   |

### BTC LRTs on ZeroLend

Beyond Ethereum, ZeroLend also supports **BTC LRTs on mainnet**, allowing Bitcoin holders to tap into DeFi opportunities without losing out on staking/locking benefits.&#x20;

### **How to Use BTC LRTs on ZeroLend**

1. **Obtain BTC LRT Tokens**
   * Acquire your preferred BTC LRT (e.g., _cbBTC, eBTC, LBTC, MBTC, SolvBTC, WBTC_) from the protocol or exchange that issues it.
   * Each token represents staked or wrapped BTC, allowing you to keep accruing BTC-based rewards or yield while still using the asset in DeFi.
2. **Navigate to the BTC LRT Market**
   * Head to ZeroLend and select the **“Bitcoin LRTs Market”** tab.
   * You’ll find a list of supported BTC LRT assets, each with its own APYs (supply or borrow) and current market statistics (Total Supplied, Total Borrowed, etc.).
3. **Supply or Borrow**
   * **Supply**: Choose the BTC LRT you hold (e.g., _cbBTC or eBTC_). Click “Details” (or its equivalent) to supply your tokens and start earning the displayed APY.
   * **Borrow**: If you already have a collateral position on ZeroLend, you can borrow BTC LRT tokens. This can be useful if you want to short an asset or deploy borrowed tokens elsewhere.
4. **Consider Leveraging**
   * If you’re looking for more advanced yield strategies, check if the BTC LRT token is compatible with **Pendle PT tokens** or leveraging solutions (e.g., Contango).
   * These integrations can let you **amplify your positions**—sometimes up to 10x—potentially unlocking higher APRs in both BTC rewards and partner tokens like $ZERO.
5. **Monitor & Manage**
   * Track your Supply APY and Borrow APY over time; they can adjust based on market supply/demand.
   * If you borrow, keep an eye on your health factor or loan-to-value ratio to avoid liquidations.
   * Periodically review new listings for better APYs, additional rewards, or new tokens (like _“eBTC PT 27MAR25”_).
6. **Redeem or Unwind**
   * When ready, withdraw your BTC LRT tokens or repay any borrowed amount.
   * Upon returning your LRT to the issuing protocol, you can claim your original BTC plus any staking rewards accrued during that period.
