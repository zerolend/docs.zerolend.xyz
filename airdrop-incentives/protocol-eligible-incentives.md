# Protocol Eligible Incentives

Protocol Incentives are airdrops provided by other protocols to encourage engagement and growth within their ecosystems. ZeroLend, operational across Ethereum, Linea, Blast, zkSync, Manta, and XLayer, benefits from these incentives.&#x20;

ZeroLend is operational across several blockchain networks, including zkSync, Manta, Blast, X Layer, and Linea. Engagement with ZeroLend and its integrated protocols enhances users' likelihood of receiving various incentives.&#x20;

As active participants in this thriving DeFi ecosystem, we are eligible for various airdrops and incentives from the protocols and networks we integrate.&#x20;

ZeroLend is committed to distributing **80%** of all airdrops directly to our stakers and liquidity providers, reinforcing our appreciation for their trust and investment in the platform. The other **20%** goes back into the development fund.&#x20;

## LRT Partners

Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) allow users to unlock liquidity from their staked assets while still earning staking rewards.

ZeroLend provides dedicated markets for LRTs like Renzo. Users can supply their assets and earn rewards such as native supply yields, $earlyZERO tokens, LRT points, and Zero Gravity Points.

## Data Feed Partners

Our lending and borrowing markets rely on high-fidelity price data from premium oracle networks like Pyth and Redstone. As a leading data customer driving significant value to their networks, Zerolend could qualify for such incentive programs as they roll out staking programs.

### Layer 2s&#x20;

As a lending market, we scale by deploying our money markets on other chains. ZeroLend is currently the leading lending market on a number of L2s.&#x20;
