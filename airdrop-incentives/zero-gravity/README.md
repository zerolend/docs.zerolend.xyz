# Zero Gravity

[Zero Gravity](https://airdrop.zerolend.xyz/) is our native airdrop points system where users can claim $ZERO airdrop by collecting Zero Gravity points.&#x20;

To incentivize users who supply and borrow on ZeroLend, we introduced native points allocation on Zero Gravity. We [launched](https://twitter.com/zerolendxyz/status/1748367922475745556) Zero Gravity Beta on January 19, 2024, and the full release opened to the public on April 10, 2024. \


## Structuring the Zero Gravity Drop <a href="#heading-structuring-the-zero-gravity-drop" id="heading-structuring-the-zero-gravity-drop"></a>

Zero Gravity will be phased out in Voyages and Chapters. Each Voyage will have 3 Chapters.

Hereâ€™s a basic structure:

* Voyage 1
  * Chapter 1
  * Chapter 2
  * Chapter 3
* Voyage 2
* Voyage 3

**With each passing Voyage and Chapter, the supply % decreases to reward the early adopters of the protocol.**
