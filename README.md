## The ZeroLend Ecosystem

The ZeroLend ecosystem comprises of various entities and features:

1. **DeFi Lending (Live):** A decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol enabling users to participate as liquidity providers or borrowers within the zkSync Ecosystem. ZeroLend also aims to provide lending\&borrowing on various supported assets across multiple chains. Powered by [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/). \
   \
   To learn more, read "[DeFi Lending](overview/decentralised-lending/)".&#x20;
2. **$ONEZ - the yield-bearing Stablecoin:** ZeroLend has its own stablecoin that is designed to capture the native yield from the lending protocol and has self loan repaying capability. Users can also mint $ONEZ and participate in DeFi within the zkSync ecosystem. \
   \

3. **ZeroLend** **Governance ($ZERO)**: A governance system for governing the ZeroLend Protocol, enabled by the $ZERO token. \
